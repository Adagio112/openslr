These are unofficial data splits for the corpus MADCAT Arabic (LDC2013T15, LDC2013T09, LDC2012T15). 
LDC is providing only training data for these corpora and not the original dev/eval sets, so the original
training data have been split into three different disjoint parts (i.e. there shouldn't be sentences/lines 
from the same document in different sets -- as each document is handwritten/transcribed 
by a different author in the MADCAT data) to allow for evaluation of the performance in the usual way.
<p/>
Also, please not that the license relates only for the splits. You still need to obtain the original databases
and respect the databases' license!
