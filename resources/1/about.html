This dataset was created for the Kaldi project (see <a href=kaldi.sf.net> kaldi.sf.net</a>),
by a contributor who prefers to remain anonymous.  The main point of the dataset is
to provide an easy way to test out the Kaldi scripts for free.</p>

The archive "waves_yesno.tar.gz" contains 60 .wav files, sampled at 8 kHz.  All were recorded
by the same male speaker, in English (although the individual is not a native speaker).
In each file, the individual says 8 words; each word is either "yes" or "no", so each
file is a random sequence of 8 yes-es or noes.  There is no separate transcription provided; the
sequence is encoded in the filename, with 1 for yes and 0 for no, for instance:
<pre>
# tar -xvzf waves_yesno.tar.gz
waves_yesno/1_0_1_1_1_0_1_0.wav
waves_yesno/0_1_1_0_0_1_1_0.wav
...
