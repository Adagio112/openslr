This resource is a mirror of LDC's sph2pipe software, which
used to be available from <a href=ftp://ftp.ldc.upenn.edu/pub/ldc/misc_sw/sph2pipe_v2.5.tar.gz> here </a>.
The license (available 0readme.1st in the archive) only permits
using it to read sphere files, but since that is the purpose of the
program it should not be a problem.
