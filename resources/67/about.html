<body>

The TEDx Spanish Corpus is a gender unbalanced corpus of 24 hours of duration. 
<p>
It contains spontaneous speech of several expositors in TEDx events; most of them are men.
<p>
Transcriptions are presented in lowercase with no punctuation marks.
<p>
The data collection process was partly developed by the social service program "Desarrollo de Tecnolog√≠as del Habla" that depends on the National Autonomous University of Mexico and partly by the CIEMPIESS-UNAM project (http://www.ciempiess.org/)
<p>
Special thanks to the TED-Talks team for allowing us to share this dataset.
