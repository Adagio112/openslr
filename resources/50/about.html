VoxCeleb1 (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/) and Speakers in the Wild (http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/sitw/) are speaker recognition datasets that have a small number of speakers in common.  These overlapping speakers should be removed from VoxCeleb1 prior to training systems that will be evaluated on Speakers in the Wild.
