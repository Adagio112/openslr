This data is transcribed speech data, in Amharic and Swahili and Wolof.
<p>
This repository is a result of the ALFFA project <a href="http://alffa.imag.fr">http://alffa.imag.fr</a><br>

We distribute READY-to-use (or READY-to-train) KALDI ASR systems and (when possible) associated corpora....<br>

A summary of these resources and ASR performances, as well as a description of the ALFFA project has been published in the following paper:
<pre>
Collecting Resources in Sub-Saharan African Languages for Automatic Speech Recognition: a Case Study of Wolof. 
Elodie Gauthier, Laurent Besacier, Sylvie Voisin, Michael Melese and Uriel Pascal Elingui. 
To appear at LREC 2016.

So far, the ASR directory contains Kaldi recipes for 4 languages : Amharic, Swahili, Hausa and Wolof.

<li> <b>AMHARIC</b> </li>
In ASR/AMHARIC/ you will find kaldi recipes + ressources - see README file for more details and ASR performance results that you should be able to reproduce - please cite this paper if you publish work using theses resources:
