The data includes non-speech sounds recorded in an anechoic room,
reconstructed signals in various rooms, impulse responses for a
microphone array, speech data recorded with the same array, and
recordings of background noises.  It is intended for use when
simulating sound scenes.  It was developed by the Real Acoustic
Environments Working Group of the Real World Computing Partnership
(RWCP).  The data was recorded from 1998 to 2000.
