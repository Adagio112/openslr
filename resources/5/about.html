This resource mirrors the transcriptions of Switchboard data that
were generated at Mississippi State, and the associated lexicon.
These were released without any license restrictions.
<p>
The <a href=http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97S62> Switchboard </a> (SWB) corpus
is one of the most important historical benchmarks
for recognition tasks involving large vocabulary conversational speech (LVCSR).
It contains 2430 conversations averaging 6 minutes in length; in other words,
over 240 hours of recorded speech, and about 3 million words of text, spoken by
over 500 speakers of both sexes from every major dialect of American English.
<p>
The initial transcriptions for SWB have error rates above 10%, resulting in poor
recognition performance, paticularly on hard to recognize words such as
monosyllabic words. This release of the SWB transcriptions, which was developed
by the Institute for Signal and Information Processing at Mississippi State
University in the late 1990's, includes transcriptions that were manually
corrected to have error rates below 1%. The release also includes
manually-adjusted segmentations and word alignments.

The following text is removed for now as we don't have the Penn Treebank stuff
included here at the moment.

Further, there is a version
of the data that is aligned to the Penn Treebank word transcriptions for all
1126 SWB conversations that are included in the Treebank.  -->
