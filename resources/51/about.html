</p>

 

<p>
Contents:
<ul>
	<li> 2351 audio talks in NIST sphere format (SPH), including talks from TED-LIUM 2: be careful, same talks but not same audio files (only these audio file must be used with the TED-LIUM 3 STM files) </li>
	<li> 452 hours of audio </li>
	<li> 2351 aligned automatic transcripts in STM format </li>

	<li> TEDLIUM 2 dev and test data: 19 TED talks in SPH format with corresponding manual transcriptions (cf. ‘legacy’ distribution below).</li>

	<li> Dictionary with pronunciations (159848 entries), same file as the one included in TED-LIUM 2 </li>
	<li> Selected monolingual data for language modeling from WMT12 publicly available corpora: these files come from the TED-LIUM 2 release, but have been modified to get a tokenization more relevant for English language </li>
</ul>
</p>

 
<p>
Two corpus distributions:
<ul>
	<li> the legacy one, on which the dev and test datasets are the same as in TED-LIUM 2 (and TED-LIUM 1). </li>
	<li> the ‘speaker adaptation’ one, especially designed for experiments on speaker adaptation. </li>
</ul>
</p>
