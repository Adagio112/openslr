Language modeling resources to be used in conjunction with the (soon-to-be-released) LibriSpeech ASR corpus.
<p>
This corpus and these resources were prepared by Vassil Panayotov with
the assistance of Daniel Povey and Sanjeev Khudanpur.  We hope to finalize
this and release the corpus here by the ICASSP deadline (early October 2014).
