The TED-LIUM corpus was made from audio talks and their transcriptions available on the TED website. We have prepared and filtered these data in order to train acoustic models to participate to the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation 2011 (the LIUM English/French SLT system reached the first rank in the SLT task). 

More details are given in this paper:
