	        <p><h3 class="slrStyle"> About OpenSLR </h3>
              OpenSLR is a site devoted to hosting speech and language resources, such as training
              corpora for speech recognition, and software related to speech recognition.  We intend to be a convenient place for anyone to
              put resources that they have created, so that they can be downloaded publicly.
            <p>
              Part of our goal is to mirror software available elsewhere, in order to provide a
              failover location.  We are starting by mirroring some software which is used
              in the <a href="http://kaldi-asr.org"> Kaldi </a> scripts.  We plan to make it easy for
              others in turn to mirror this site; please ask us for details.
            <p>
              We aim to provide a central, hassle-free place for others to put their speech resources.
              For more information, see <a href=/contributions.html> here </a>.
            <p>
              For a list of resources, please click on <a href="resources.php" target="_top"> resources </a> above.
            <p>
             If you want to download things from this site, please download them one at a time, and please don't use
             any fancy software-- just download things from your browser or use 'wget'.
             We have noticed a number of people who seem to be trying to download many things simultaneously,
             and we have had to block their IPs in order to avoid site-wide slowdown.  We also had to add a firewall rule to
             drop connections from hosts with more than 5 simultaneous connections.  If you want to
             create a mirror of this site, just ask us and we'll help you set it up.  A mirror in China
             would be particularly appreciated, since most of our problematic http requests seem to come from there.
