This directory is used to store the Apache config file "openslr"; we made a soft link like this:
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
ln -s /var/www/openslr/config/openslr .
This is done so that we can put it in the same git repository as the html and php of the site's 
contents.
(note: for reasons of size, we can't do the same for the directory "/var/www/openslr/resources/" 
here the actual resources we export are kept.)
